# Entinostat_ICI_scRNAseq

Entinostat decreases immune suppression to promote an anti-tumor response within a HER2+ breast tumor microenvironment.

We use epigenetic modulation to sensitize HER2+ tumors to immune checkpoint inhibition in a breast 
cancer model. We applied single cell RNA sequencing to elucidate the effects of epigenetic modulator 
entinostat and aPD1, aCTLA4 immune checkpoint inhibitors in the immune tumor microenvironment. 
Our results lead to a model that entinostat treatment promotes tumor killing mechanisms by promoting 
an anti-tumor myeloid cell signature and reducing immunosuppression in MDSC cell subtypes. 
The combined alterations in the myeloid compartment ultimately improve T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity.
